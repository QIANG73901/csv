"2. Course Description and Aims"
""
"This course invites students to think critically about the interaction between technological"
"change and the globalisation cycle. This is a crucial dynamic that has and will continue to"
"shape Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the world. Technological change in the digital age"
"has played a key role in deepening the integration of global markets and in quickening"
"the diffusion of ideas, knowledge, and technologies. Ironically, these processes have also"
"unleashed forces that have blunted or even reversed the momentum for further economic"
"integration and political cooperation on a global basis. The impact of the digital age on the"
"globalisation cycle has also raised questions on a host of issues, including the resurgence"
"of great power competition, the ability of the global economy to accommodate distinctive"
"(and sometimes opposing) economic systems, the use of global technology supply chains"
"as geopolitical weapons, the nationalistic pursuit of technological might, and the integrity"
"of the nation state. These questions are not new and are merely the current form of prior"
"debates concerning the impact of technological change in earlier globalisation cycles."
"In short, globalisation is neither irreversible nor inevitable. This course will impart this"
"central lesson to students by placing globalisation and de-globalisation in the digital age"
"within the context of historical globalisation cycles."
""
""
"Course Structure"
"This course is a 2.5-credit unit course presented over three weeks."
""
"There are three Study Units in this course. The following provides an overview of each"
"Study Unit."
""
""
"Study Unit 1 – Technological Change and the Globalisation Cycle"
""
"Please note that there are two chapters in Study Unit 1: (1) Technological Change and"
"the Globalisation Cycle, and (2) The Diffusion of Technology across Time and Space."
"Study Unit 1 introduces and discusses three central questions: (a) What is globalisation,"
"(b) What is technology, and (c) what is the relationship between technology and"

""
""
"globalisation. Study Unit 1 provides a foundation to understand these questions in both"
"historical and contemporary contexts. This is to facilitate application of key concepts,"
"such as globalisation, technological innovation (and indeed the idea of innovation itself)"
"and technological diffusion, to socio-economic and geo-poltiical situations, such as the"
"tensions between global forces and national or local imperatives and their consequent"
"impact on international relations. It is also hoped that the ideas, themes, concepts,"
"questions, and debates illustrated in this Study Unit will strengthen your ability to"
"recognise the causes and consequences of global issues/trends and to understand that"
"complex local and global issues may impact different segments of society differently and"
"thus cannot be easily resolved."
""
""
"Study Unit 2 – Globalisation in the Digital Age"
""
"Please note that there are two chapters in Study Unit 2: (1) The Impact of the Digital Age"
"on Globalisation and (2) Technological Change and Diffusion in the Digital Age. Study"
"Unit 2 explores and discusses several implications of globalisation in the specific context"
"of the Digital Age. These can include the movement of people, goods and ideas across"
"borders, the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on those"
"movements – particularly in differentiating between physical and digital globalisation,"
"and the impact of digital technologies on the concepts of globalisation and degloblisation."
"Central to these issues is the evolving roles and responsibilities of the individual living in"
"increasingly diverse and complex local and global communities. Study Unit 2 provides a"
"foundation from which students are encouraged to imagine ways in which the individual"
"can advocate for local and global issues and to effect sustainable change for the betterment"
"of others and society in general."
""
""
"Study Unit 3 – The Politics of Globalisation in the Digital Age"
""
"Please note that there are two chapters in Study Unit 3: (1) The Nation State in the Digital"
"Age and (2) International Politics in the Digital Age. Study Unit 3 applies the themes"
"of globalisation and technology and related issues to the contexts of the nation-state as"

"entrenchment of digital technologies in the twenty-first century has not only resulted in"
"intra-national dislocations and pressures, they have also been used in either provoking"
"or sustaining territorial conflicts and diplomatic tensions. National governments have"
"responded to the multifaceted impact of digital technologies. They have been harnessing"
"and developing its potential to strengthen its policies, e.g. Singapore’s Smart Nation"
"initiative, and to collaborate across national borders, e.g. the ASEAN Smart City Network"
"(ASCN). At the same time, national governments have also introduced legislative"
"measures to regulate Big Tech and to curb the excesses of its products. Topics in this"
"Study Unit will facilitate discussion to better understand how various nations in the"
"world, including Singapore, take steps to protect its national interests and to defend its"
"sovereignty and territorial integrity in the Digital Age."

"1.1 What is globalisation?"
"As an economic phenomenon, globalisation refers to the integration of global markets"
""
"for goods, services, capital, labour, and ideas.1 As will be shown below, globalisation"
"is driven by many factors. One of these factors is the emergence and deployment of"
"new technologies (e.g. new forms of transport) that reduce the costs and increase the"
""
"speed and the ease of moving goods, capital, labour, and ideas across different markets.2"
"Thus, the intensification of economic globalisation will usually be reflected in the growth"
"of international trade (i.e. countries are importing/exporting more goods and services"
"from/to each other), the growth of cross-border capital movements (i.e. countries are"
"borrowing/lending more from/to each other; or investing more in each other), and the"
"growth of international migration (i.e. more people are crossing national/political borders"
""
"in order to find employment or for other reasons).3"
""
"It is, of course, not compulsory for all countries to integrate themselves with the global"
"market. A country may choose, perhaps for political or ideological reasons, to pursue"
"economic self-sufficiency or autarky. What does this mean? This means that the country"
"will severely limit and control all forms of economic exchange (e.g. trade and capital"
"movements) with foreign countries and choose to rely on its internal economic resources."

""
""
"This means, for example, that the residents and entities based in an autarkic country will"
""
"only import/export a low quantity of goods and services from/to other countries.4"
""
"The concept of autarky will help us to understand the meaning of economic de-"
"globalisation. Simply put, de-globalisation refers to the reversal of globalisation. Thus,"
"as an economic phenomenon, de-globalisation will usually be reflected in the decline of"
""
"international trade, cross-border capital movements, and international migration.5 When"
"taken to its logical and extreme conclusion, economic de-globalisation will result in the"
"emergence of autarkic or semi-autarkic economies."

""
"1.1.1 When did globalisation begin?"
""
"The term ‘globalisation’ only gained wide currency in the 1990s.6 But activities that"
"echo the definition of economic globalisation presented above can be detected in earlier"
"periods. Thus, ‘globalisation’ is not a new economic phenomenon. But how old is it?"
"Scholars largely agree that ‘globalisation’ is not new, but they disagree as to how old it"
"is. Did ‘globalisation’ commence hundreds of years ago or perhaps even thousands of"
""
"years ago?7 The economists Kevin O’Rourke and Jeffrey G. Williamson have argued that"
""
"‘globalisation’ began in the 1820s.8 They arrived at this conclusion by taking the narrowing"
"of prices differences between similar commodities sold in different parts of the world as"
""
"the main outward sign of successful globalisation.9"

"The term ‘technology’ appeared in the English language for the first time in the"

"learning, or discourse, or treatise concerned with the mechanic arts.’40 Moreover, the word"

"In the United States, it was not until the start of the twentieth century that ‘technology’"

"However, usage of the term would only become more widespread by the 1930s.43"

"According to David E. Nye, the term ‘technology’ would eventually come, by the mid-"

""
"Thereafter, the meaning of the term continued to stay volatile.45 During the 1990s,"
"as briefly mentioned above, the media began to equate ‘technology’ with information"
"technology."

"Apart from information technology and digital technologies, what are some of the"

"Technology is often thought of in our present age as ‘applied science’.46 But, as we shall"

""
"McClellan and Dorn show that the work of ‘technological practitioners’ and the pursuit"
"of scientific knowledge largely took place in separate spheres of activity before the"

"The construction of sturdy bridges between science and technology only took place in the"

"perception of ‘technology’ as ‘applied science’.54"

"Why is it important to understand the background of the term ‘applied science’? The"
"term ‘applied science’ implies that formal scientific understanding necessarily precedes"
"technological achievement. But, as the example of the steam engine shows, this was not"

"A correct understanding of the relationship between ‘science’ and ‘technology’ will help"

"lead us to define a particular set of policy, business, and educational choices. But this set of"
"choices and possibilities will be enriched and enlarged if we understand that technology"
"has often preceded science. It is clear, for example, that the recognition that ‘technology"

"2.2 The market and technological diffusion"
"We have already seen that governments are able to drive the global diffusion of"
"technologies through interventionist policies aimed at economic and technological"
"catch-up. It need hardly be said that private economic agents (e.g. private inventors,"
"entrepreneurs, corporations, consumers) are also key players in the process of"
"technological change, adoption, and diffusion. The transnational corporation, for"
"example, has long been seen as one of the key agents of international technological"
"diffusion. Host nations, so we are told, will benefit from the infusion of technologies"
"and techniques that naturally accompanies the foreign direct investment (FDI) carried"
""
"out by transnational corporations.115 It should also be noted, in keeping with this study"
"unit’s criticism of innovation-worship, that businesses very often simply replicate existing"
""
"technologies rather than create new ones. Indeed, this is the historical norm.116"
""
"We should, of course, broaden our conception of ‘space’ when reflecting on the diffusion"
"of technologies. Technological diffusion takes place between and within nations (or"
"other polities). Within a particular polity, technological adoption and access may differ"
"according to, among other categories, gender, education level, income, race, cultural"
""
"preferences, and political status.117 Indeed, several of these categories are often mentioned"
""
"in discussions of inequalities in internet access and digital proficiency.118"

"As we saw earlier in our examples of the different consumer responses to similar"
"technologies in different countries, consumer behaviour is a major factor that drives"
"technological adoption and diffusion. The crucial point to note, as Nye stresses, is that"
"consumers may utilise new technologies in ways that were not anticipated by their"
"creators. Nye points out that Thomas Edison viewed the phonograph as a work tool and"
""
"failed to see its consumer applications in ‘music and entertainment’.119 In a similar way,"
"the architects of the internet did not conceive of its present consumer-oriented uses (e.g. e-"
""
"commerce).120 This shows that a new technology crafted for a specific purpose or to meet a"
"specific need may, in the course of time, accumulate other purposes or be directed towards"
"other needs. Thus, the consumer’s ‘imagination’ is a key factor that drives technological"
""
"adoption and diffusion.121"
""
"Governments, as mentioned earlier, are often motivated by defence and economic"
"concerns in their pursuit of technological strength. But what about private motivations?"
"In addition to basic curiosity and profit, what encourages inventors, businesses, and"
"financiers to risk their time and their capital on new technologies? Scholars have"
"highlighted the role of a conducive institutional environment – e.g. protection of property"
""
"rights and intellectual property – in encouraging entrepreneurial activities.122 There is"
"also a long tradition in scholarly commentary of reflecting on the ‘cultural’ reasons for"
"technological change. Are some cultures simply more receptive/hostile to technological"
""
"change than others?123 For example, there are those who have attributed East Asia’s"
"ability to close the technological and economic gap with other wealthier nations to"
""
"‘Confucianism’.124This echoes the sociologist Max Weber’s famous argument that the"
""
"emergence of capitalism in the west could be attributed to Protestant Christianity.125"

"Summary"
""
"This study unit has discussed three central issues (as well as other related questions):"
""
"a.   What is globalisation?"
"b.   What is technology?"
"c.   and what is the relationship between technology and globalisation?"
""
"What is globalisation? As an economic phenomenon, globalisation refers to the integration"
"of global markets for goods, services, capital, labour and ideas. Globalisation is not a"
"new phenomenon, though scholars disagree as to precisely how old it is. Globalisation is"
"also not ‘irreversible’ and ‘inevitable’. This is because the decision to embrace economic"
"openness is a political one. Globalisation creates ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in every nation. As"
"we have seen, the ‘losers’ may be able to use their political influence to shift their country"
"towards protectionism and economic nationalism."
""
"What is technology? The meaning of the term ‘technology’ has shifted over time and will"
"in all likelihood continue to do so in the future. In our present age, technology is often"
"thought of as ‘applied science’ and is linked tightly with ‘innovation’. Technologically"
"deterministic perspectives are also commonly expressed in today’s world. We questioned"
"these common connotations of technology in this Study Unit. We saw that it is not"
"entirely accurate to describe technology as ‘applied science’. This is because, historically,"
"technology often preceded science and not the other way around. We also saw that"
"technology should not be equated with innovation. Finally, we examined the flaws"
"of technologically deterministic perspectives in this Study Unit. We saw evidence that"
"demonstrates that humans are in control of technology and not the other way around. We"
"also saw that technological change is driven by social context."
""
"What is the basic relationship between globalisation and technology? Technological"
"change may accelerate the integration of global markets for goods, services, capital, labour,"
"and ideas if it drives down the costs of moving goods, services, capital, labour, and"
"ideas across different markets. But, as we have seen, the emergence of such technological"

""
""
""
"developments will not automatically create more globalisation. This is because nations"
"can choose, for political and ideological reasons, to reject economic openness."
""
"Finally, we also examined the factors that drive technological change, adoption, and"
"diffusion in this study unit. We saw that state policies that are aimed at achieving"
"technological catch-up are among the key drivers of technological diffusion. These"
"policies may be interventionist or laissez-faire in nature. We also saw that transnational"
"corporations are major vehicles of international technological diffusion. Consumers, too,"
"play an important role in shaping the adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Very"
"often, consumers end up using new technologies in ways that were not anticipated by"
"their creators. We also tackled the question of what encourages inventors and businessmen"
"to risk their time and their capital on new technologies. We highlighted the importance"
"of a conducive institutional environment and noted that many scholars have also"
"sought to identify the ‘cultural’ reasons for technological change. Finally, we identified"
"technochauvinism as one of the factors that drives technological adoption in the modern"
"world."
""
"In chapter 2, we also stressed the importance of broadening our conception of time and"
"space when analysing the course of technological change, adoption, and diffusion. In"
"addition to cross-border diffusion, we also need to pay attention to trends in intra-nation"
"diffusion. We must also be wary of linear narratives of technological change that give us"
"the impression that new technologies are constantly displacing old technologies. The truth"
"is that many old technologies remain in use because they continue to provide solutions to"
"our problems."

"1.1 The ICT revolution and globalisation"
"According to the economist Richard Baldwin, the rise of ICT (information and"
"communications technology) has shaped the course of globalisation from the 1990s to"
"the recent present in a way that differs profoundly from the impact of earlier phases of"
"technological change on the integration of global markets. Baldwin’s analysis of the past,"
"present, and future of globalisation is anchored onto the impact of technological change"
""
"on the costs of moving physical goods, human labour, and ideas across different markets.1"
"We will summarise the thrust of Baldwin’s argument in this section."
""
""
"1.1.1 Moving goods across borders"
"Before the emergence of steam technologies, it was exorbitantly expensive and"
"cumbersome to move physical goods, human labour, and ideas across borders. The sheer"
"difficulties involved in conquering large distances meant that economic activity was"
"concentrated in self-sufficient communities. In other words, there was no market-driven"
"geographical uncoupling of production and consumption. Instead, these two activities"
"had to take place within close range of each other. For example, a village would have"
"to manufacture and cultivate its own necessities for internal use instead of buying and"
""
"selling such necessities on the global market.2"
""
"But the emergence of the new transport technologies of the nineteenth-century – steam"
"(and, later, diesel) transport – drove down the costs of moving physical goods across"
"borders. In other words, technological change in the nineteenth century vanquished"

"distance as a barrier to the integration of global markets. It was now economically feasible"
"for production and consumption to take place in entirely different geographical zones."
"Communities were no longer required to be self-sufficient. They could simply purchase"
""
"necessities and other goods from producers located in distant lands.3"
""
"However, Baldwin notes that technological change in the nineteenth century did not"
"significantly drive down the costs of moving human labour and ideas across borders. The"
"new communications technologies (the telegraph and the telephone) that were developed"
"and deployed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not, in Baldwin’s"
"view, reduce the difficulties involved in transmitting and communicating sophisticated"
""
"knowledge across borders.4 Due to the high costs of moving human labour and ideas"
"across borders, it was simply not economical for firms to disperse their production"
"processes and stages across different geographical zones. All of these processes and stages"
"had to be concentrated within massive manufacturing facilities and industrial zones. In"
"short, the ‘factory’ was a logical response to the high costs of moving human labour and"
""
"ideas cross borders.5 Moreover, the high costs of moving ideas across borders deepened"
"the wealth disparity between the advanced nations and the less developed nations. The"
"concentrated nature of production – the only economical option, as mentioned above –"
"triggered self-reinforcing cycles of innovation, industrial growth, and income growth in"
"an elite group of nations (broadly speaking, the ‘west’ and Japan). But the innovations"
"generated in the course of this virtuous cycle could not be easily transferred to foreign"

"1.1.2 Moving ideas across borders"
"The state of affairs described in the previous section was finally upended, from the"
"1990s onwards, by the new technologies of the ‘ICT revolution’ – namely, the computer,"
"the internet, and other related systems. The ICT revolution, Baldwin explains, finally"
"drove down the costs of transmitting and communicating sophisticated knowledge across"
""
"borders.7 This meant that it was now possible to disaggregate production processes"
"and stages and spread them across different international locations. In short, low-cost"
"communications had finally made it possible for firms to organise and manage so-called"
"‘global value chains’. The advanced economies thus began to ‘outsource’ production"
"stages and processes to low-wage nations. In effect, they exported their ‘ideas’ – their"
"production knowledge and the fruits of their innovation efforts – to foreign sources of"
""
"low-cost labour.8 This process triggered deindustrialisation in the advanced economies"
"and boosted the economic and industrial strength of the parts of the developing world"
""
"that were the main recipients of the exported ‘ideas’.9"
""
"By driving down the costs of shifting ideas across borders, ICT made it economical and"
""
"feasible for firms to export production capabilities.10 However, the ICT revolution, in"
"Baldwin’s opinion, did not drive down the costs of moving labour across borders. At the"
"same time, in-person collaboration remained necessary for ensuring the smooth operation"
"of global value chains. The implication was that the ‘people’ managing global value chains"
"still needed to be located within reasonable reach of each other. This was reflected in the"
"concentration of labour and talent in major urban centres and the tendency for advanced"
""
"economies to outsource production to nations in their geographical backyard.11"

"1.1.3 The future of globalisation"
"What does the future hold for globalisation? Baldwin believes that the next phase of"
"globalisation (‘Globalisation 4.0’) will be powered by technologies that will finally drive"
""
"down the costs of moving human labour across borders.12 He is not referring, in this vision"
"of the future, to new technologies that will magically speed up the physical movement of"
"human labour across borders. Instead, Baldwin is referring to new digital technologies"
"that will lead to highly advanced forms of international remote working. This will"
"allow professionals and workers to perform tasks for foreign customers without crossing"
""
"national borders.13"
""
"According to Baldwin, these technological developments could lead to dramatic changes"
"in the service sector. Many services, unlike goods and ideas, do not enter into the flows"
"of international exchange. For example, you cannot ‘export’ or ‘import’ hairdressing or"
"many types of repair services. Many services at present can only be delivered and received"
"in-person and on-site. The hairdresser cannot ‘export’ his/her hairdressing services to"
"someone living in another country who wants a haircut. Futuristic remote working"
"technologies, however, may finally allow a broader range of services to become exportable"
"and importable. When this happens, high-cost service sector workers in certain countries"
"will finally be forced to compete with equally skilled low-cost service sector workers from"
""
"other parts of the world.14 It is too early to tell if this vision of future globalisation will"
"come to pass, but it cannot be denied that a degree of change is afoot. We have already seen"

"remarked on applications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution30 – that could tie consumer"
""
"activity with factory activity.31 Livesey noted that, in time, the drive to achieve large-scale"
"customisation would persuade companies to tighten their control of their supply chains"
""
"instead of offshoring most production stages to foreign lands.32 In addition, the growing"
"customer demand for rapid deliveries, which, Livesey pointed out, could be partially"
"attributed to the influence of e-commerce companies, would also persuade firms to situate"

"more production processes in the countries where customer purchases were occurring.33"

"What does digital or being digital mean? The term “digital” comes from “digit”, referring"
"to the numbers 0 to 9. Essentially, “digital” means to store or communicate information"

"as a series of the numbers 0 and 1, or in a binary format.42 This contrasts with the"
"term “analogue”, which refers to data that is represented by a “continuously variable"
"physical quantity”, in other words, attributes that can be physical measured, e.g. length,"

"weight, voltage, pressure, or spatial positions.43 One comparative example would be the"
"digital clock or watch using digits to show the time, and an analogue version that uses"
"the hour and minute hands. Another example would be the data or images stored in a"

"Summary"
""
"In sum, Study Unit 2 asks us to consider some of the broader economic and social"
"implications of globalisation in this Digital Age. At first glance, it may appear that"
"globalisation has sped up as a result of increased adoption and diffusion of digital devices."
"But as this first topic of Study Unit 2 discusses, there may be a difference between physical"
"globalisation and digital globalisation. The latter may bring communities across the world"
"closer together, but certain aspects of physical globalisation – the original basis of earlier"
"cycles of globalisation – may actually slow or even enter a de-globalisation phase. In"
"other words, while the exchange of ideas may increase with improvements in digital"
"communications, the exchange of goods, services and labour may slow or even reverse."
"Hence, it is important to be aware of different types of globalisations, which in turn may"
"have varying implications and consequences."
""
"The second chapter of Study Unit 2 invites us to take a couple of steps back and"
"reflect on what it means to be digital, and from there, reflect on the implications of our"
"understanding of the term. The term “digital” has evolved beyond its original binary"
"meaning of zeroes and ones, especially when applied to various social contexts, which"
"usually take it to mean something progressive, modern, convenient or efficient. That is"
"why it is important to remember the so-called analogue origins of digital devices, and"
"indeed the continued presence and necessity of non-digital infrastructure to support"
"digital communications. One does not exist without the other, and both will always be"
"anchored by conventional human motivations to invent and innovate technologically."

"for driving down the costs of moving ideas across different markets?"
""
"a.   Steam transport"
""
"Incorrect. Steam transport drove down the costs of moving goods across"
"borders, not ideas."
""
"b.   The telephone"
""
"Incorrect. According to Baldwin, the telephone (as well as the telegraph) did"
"not drive down the costs of moving ideas across borders."
""
"c.   ICT"
""
"Correct. According to Baldwin, ICT drove down the costs of moving ideas"
"across different markets from the 1990s onwards. This paved the way for"
"the outsourcing of production processes to low-wage nations."

""
"3.   Which of the following statements about digital globalisation is correct?"
""
"a.   Digital globalisation is the result of physical de-globalisation."
""
"Incorrect. Physical de-globalisation refers to the weakening of cross-border"

"Study Unit 3 applies the themes of globalisation and technology and related issues to"
"the contexts of the nation-state as well as of the nation-state in regional and international"
"situations. The emergence and entrenchment of digital technologies in the twenty-first"
"century has not only resulted in intra-national dislocations and pressures, they have also"
"been used in either provoking or sustaining territorial conflicts and diplomatic tensions."
"National governments have responded to the multifaceted impact of digital technologies."
"They have been harnessing and developing its potential to strengthen its policies, e.g."
"Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, and to collaborate across national borders, e.g. the"
"ASEAN Smart City Network (ASCN). At the same time, national governments have"
"also introduced legislative measures to regulate Big Tech and to curb the excesses of"
"its products. Topics in this Study Unit will facilitate discussion to better understand"
"how various nations in the world, including Singapore, take steps to protect its national"

"Chapter 1: The Nation-State in the Digital Age"
""
"Ever since the nation-state emerged from the political demise of former empires after the"
"Second World War, it has been the defining political unit in world history. Despite repeated"
"claims of its eventual demise, especially by advocates of globalisation who suggest, among"
"other things, how digital technology can create a global village by rendering national"
"boundaries meaningless, the nation-state remains prominent and relevant in these first"
"decades of the twenty-first century. This chapter discusses the dynamics of the nation-"

"communicated, and from there, to discuss how the nation-state navigates and manages"
"the impact of digital technologies."

"1.1 Communicating Nationalism"
"Political scientist Benedict Anderson described the nation as an “imagined political"
"community”, because the “members of even the smallest nation will never know their"
"fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the"
""
"image of their communion.”1 For example, an individual Singaporean may not know all"
"other Singaporeans on the island, but he or she may still perceive certain similarities or"
"find solidarity in how Singaporeans speak, behave or react in certain situations. These"
"perceptions of similarities in turn form the basis of a sense of kinship, togetherness or"
"solidarity, which becomes a basis of belonging, despite actual inequalities or exploitation"
"within that community. This part of the chapter explores nationalism as a concept and"
"how the idea of nationalism is transmitted or communicated."

""
"1.1.1 Nation, Nationalism and Sovereignty"
"Before proceeding further, Anderson’s reflections on nationalism introduces certain"
"approaches and concepts relevant for this course. First, nationalism is not a synonym"
"for various types of ideologies, such as Liberalism or Fascism. He noted that it would"
""
"be more productive to approach nationalism and the nation anthropologically,2 that is to"
"study how nationalism originated, its cultural roots and characteristics of the nation, how"
"both “behaved” and developed over time. This approach allows for a more holistic and"
"structural understanding of nation and nationalism, rather than unwittingly connecting"
"those terms to specific ideologies."
""
"Second, Anderson suggested that the nation is limited, that is the nation is finite and hence"
""
"is distinct from other nations.3 Throughout history, there have been various expressions"
"of distinctiveness that resulted in new nation-states. For example, American colonists"
"initiated the War of Independence in 1775 to break away from Great Britain – specifically"
"from the British monarchy’s attempt to impose greater economic control through taxes –"
"and in doing so, created the United States of America. Similarly, the 1911 revolution led by"
"Sun Yat Sen and other revolutionaries who were determined to replace the Qing dynasty"
"with a republic (a political situation where power is not concentrated in a monarch, but"
"held by the public and expressed through their elected representatives). Closer to home,"
"the pioneering generation of nationalists in Singapore, their outlooks sharpened by the"
"Japanese Occupation and global decolonisation, agitated for political independence from"
"British imperialism, eventually attaining it in 1963 (when Singapore joined the Federation"
"of Malaya to form Malaysia)."
""
"The above examples show expressions of political and economic differences. There are also"
"social and cultural differences, such as ethnicity, language and religion, or even differences"
"in how to manage those differences. For example, Singapore separated from Malaysia"
"to become an independent nation-state in 1965, partly due to the divergence between"

"People’s Action Party and the Barisan Nasional in how to manage Malaysia’s multiracial"
"society. The populations of nation-states in general are never homogenous, that is while"
"they may see and present themselves as American, Chinese (in the political, not ethnic,"
"sense) or Singaporean, they may be of different ethnicities and hold a diverse range of"
"views and beliefs."
""
"As such, the imagining of the nation must constantly be reiterated, not just to give"
"meaning, structure and tangibility to the nation, but also to provide a platform for"
"diverse outlooks to at least believe in a common vision. Here, state apparatus play an"
"important role. For the purposes of this course, we can define a state as a polity that has"
"clear territorial boundaries, managed by a government to ensure the integrity of those"
"boundaries. Max Weber’s classic definition of the state as a polity or organisation that has"
""
"a monopoly on the legitimate use of force or violence,4 has some relevance here. If we take"
"a broader view of “force”, that is as the power to enforce its will, we can understand the"
"state as an entity or organisation that enforces laws, executes state policies and its related"
"processes, e.g. collecting taxes, regulating the economy, maintaining law and order, or"
"ensuring basic literacy in public schools."
""
"Seen that way, state apparatus can and have been brought to bear with its tangible"
"processes and structures, providing meaning and a sense of identity to the nation."
"For instance, serving National Service, considered as a rite of passage for Singaporean"
"males and their supporting families, is an integral part of the Singaporean identity."
"Other more subtle but no less significant usage of state apparatus to reinforce national"
"identity includes the annual National Day Parades, days set aside for commemoration"
"such as Total Defence Day or Racial Harmony Day, or the regular singing of “Majulah"
"Singapura” (Singapore’s national anthem) and reciting of the national pledge in front of"
"the national flag in schools. These are not unique to Singapore. The People’s Republic"

"Third, Anderson noted that the nation is sovereign.5 Taken on its own, the term"
"“sovereign” usually refers to an individual or institution exercising legitimate or accepted"
"authority over groups of people, usually within a territory. This concept evolved from the"
"historical context of the wars of religion that afflicted sixteenth and seventeenth-century"
"Europe, where being sovereign meant being free from the political and religious authority"
"of the Catholic Church as well as the feudal lords the former supported. The wars ended"
"with the Peace of Westphalia, referencing a series of treaties signed in 1648. Political"
"scientists and scholars of international law have generally interpreted the treaties as the"
"beginnings of the modern international system of states. One guiding principle of this"
"system was the avoidance of interference in the internal affairs of other states or polities"
"(ostensibly to allow the sovereign in those states and polities to exercise their authority)."

"gained traction from the eighteenth century and it was enshrined in enshrined in Article"

"Anderson’s use of “sovereign” and implicit understanding of sovereignty draws from"
"this historical context, where sovereign means to be autonomous, self-determining, and"
"ideally free from external interference in its internal affairs. Anderson suggested that"

"or organisations of society that centred on religion and its leaders (such as the Catholic"

"How did nationalistic ideas spread and how did those processes bring strangers together"
"in the analogue pre-Digital Age? In his discussion of the origins of national consciousness,"
"Anderson identified a historical interplay between a technology of communications"
"(print), capitalism (“a system of production and productive relations”) – both of which"
"combined into something known as “print-capitalism”, and quite critically, the emergence"
""
"of print-language.10 He noted that this historical interplay occurred against the backdrop"
"of gradual historical shifts in societal and political attitudes caused by the Reformation"
"and Enlightenment movements. The shifts included: (1) disagreeing that society “was"
"naturally organised around and under high beings – monarchs who were persons apart"
""
"from other human beings and who ruled by some form of … (divine) dispensation”;11"
"(2) gradually disbelieving that “particular script-language offered privileged access to"
""
"ontological truth”12 – in other words, knowledge can also be attained through vernacular"
"languages; and (3) having a conception of temporality (or time) that allows for individual"
""
"consciousness (and imagination).13"
""
"The printing press (invented by Johannes Gutenberg in c. 1440) and its subsequent"
"widespread use, combined with the emergence of capitalism (which can be understood in"
"the context of this course as mass production for profit), gave birth to “print-capitalism”. In"
"earlier times, print made visible and tangible what was otherwise seemingly unattainable"
"or sacred. In doing so, it not only communicated information and news (through"
"newspapers), but also encouraged imagination (through the novel)."

"For example, Martin Luther, a Germanic priest widely seen as the catalyst for the"
"Reformation, printed his famed ninety-five theses in response to what he saw as the"

"of the theses were apparently “seen in every part of the country”.14 The printed copies"
"moreover were made more accessible as Luther printed the theses in the vernacular"
"German language. This move enabled his ideas to reach out to the masses who could not"
"read and speak Latin, the language used in scholarship, government administration and"
"other formal situations in Europe at that point in time."
""
"This brings us to “print-language”. Print-languages are more than just a language to"
"communicate information and ideas – they “laid the basis for national consciousness…” in"
""
"three ways.15 First, they created “unified fields of exchange and communication” between"
"the official / elite languages and the diverse variety of spoken vernaculars. As such,"
"print-languages are not only able to reach out to more than just the elite few using the"
"former; they also create platforms for mutual understanding with a language that cuts"
"across diversities and brings people together. Second, they lend a fixity to the language,"
"which allowed information and ideas to be reproduced practically infinitely, not just from"
""
"person to person, but also over time and geographical space.16 In other words, ideas"
"can escape their original time or geographical space through reprinting and translation."
"Third, in adopting a particular vernacular as the print-language, certain languages or"
"dialects, such as English, French, German, Arabic, Mandarin or Malay, were elevated to a"

"“new politico-cultural significance”.17 Many of these print-languages became and remain"

"shared examples that we may be familiar with or even wish for in making work and"

"in those, and then bring the discussion to contemporary times to understand present-day"

"2.1 Historical International Rivalries"
"Our world has witnessed and recorded several significant international rivalries, most"
"significantly the two World Wars and the ensuing Cold War between the United States"
"of Americas (and its affiliates) and the Soviet Union (and its affiliates). From a historical"
"perspective, one could trace a deep-lying source of these rivalries to a period of time"
"when Europeans traversed, explored and then dominated the world. This roughly began"
"from the time Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean and “discovered” the"
"Americas in 1492 (in his bid to find another route to Asia). Spanish and Portuguese"
"explorations followed soon after, colonising the areas known today as the Caribbean and"
"South America. Throughout the seventeenth century (i.e. the 1600s), the British established"
"the original thirteen colonies in North America, the basis for the present-day United States"
"of America. From the eighteenth century onwards, the British established settler colonies"
"in Africa, South Asia, Oceania (present-day Australia and New Zealand) and the Pacific"

"Islands.60"

"Closer to Singapore and Southeast Asia, the Portuguese was the first European nation"
"to make its mark in the region by capturing Melaka in 1511 (and in the process,"
"altering the course of Malay-world history). Not long after, the Spanish colonised the"
"archipelagic territory known today as the Philippines from 1565. The Dutch established"

"Driven in no small part by competition and rivalry between the European nations,"
"exploration and settlement intensified from the nineteenth century onwards, evolving"
"into outright annexation of territories and imposition of European culture and beliefs. By"
"the 1800s, the British, the Dutch and the Spanish were seen as the older, more traditional"
"powers by newer nations like France, Germany and Italy. By the early twentieth century,"
"the world was divided between these European powers, with the British Empire being"
"the largest. The European domination of the world was moreover made possible in no"
"small part by technological advancements and adaptation, supported by industrial might,"
"and quite critically the willpower to use such technologies to pacify or subjugate others."
"These technologies notably include steam power (which made travel faster and less"
"dependent on nature), telegraphy (to keep in touch with far-flung ends of empire), and the"
"advancements made by the Industrial Revolution (which drove demand and the search"

"2.3 Techno-Nationalism and Techno-Globalism"
"With that in mind, it may be useful to end Study Unit 3 with a short discussion of"
"two concepts, techno-nationalism and techno-globalism, to help us better understand"
"the themes and topics outlined above, and from there, how else can we understand and"
"present the issues discussed in this Study Unit and this course overall to others. In general,"
"concepts are useful devices to help us organise our thoughts regarding particular issues"
"or questions. But we must also be aware that concepts have a history of their own and"
"may not universally applicable. In other words, concepts are formulated or created within"
"a particular context, they have an original meaning specific to that particular context, and"
"we must be aware that their original meaning can evolve with continuous usage over time."
""
"The first concept is techno-nationalism, an abbreviated version perhaps of technological"
"nationalism. David Edgerton, a historian of science, observes that this term assumes"
"“the key unit of analysis for the study of technology is the nation: nations are the"
"units that innovate, that have R&D budgets and cultures of innovation, that diffuse and"
""
"use technology”.73 In other words, the nation is the principal driver for technological"
"innovation, providing funds, creating the workspaces and culture, and is responsible"
"for the spread and utilisation of technology. Edgarton cautions us such a situation"
"appears to be so because the concept originated and evolved in the context of nations"
"seeking to differentiate themselves by claiming ownership (for the lack of a better word)"
"over technological innovations and key innovators, or technological supremacy over"
""
"others.74 Such an approach makes several assumptions, including “national economic"
"and technological performance is determined by national rates of innovation”, that rich"
"nations have an obligation to innovate to keep ahead of poorer nations, and hence, that"

"Singapore. At first glance, it does appear that Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative as well"
"as Singapore’s leading role in the ASEAN Smart City Network are expressions of techno-"
"nationalism. In other words, Singapore’s government is taking the lead in spearheading"
"R&D in various Smart Nation projects, and from public statements on the initiative,"
"there also appears to be direct correlation between those and Singapore’s economic"
"growth and national identity. Going further, an interesting question arises, especially"
"regarding the point of technological sharing (or transfers of expertise and equipment"
"across technological borders): while the broad goals and strategies are clear enough in"
"the Smart Nation website, the website does not immediately indicate the individuals or"
"organisations responsible for leading these projects and their technological innovations."
"One could reasonably assume that the relevant government agencies are responsible for"
"those."

"and/or import skills, expertise and relevant equipment (hardware and software) to ensure"
"the Smart Nation initiatives remain on track. From there, one could also begin to become"
"more aware of the broader connections and impact of the initiative. For example, on the"
"nation’s policies on migration (who to allow in for work; space for housing and leisure;"

"The second concept Edgerton discusses is techno-globalism, a term not often used, but"
"its implications and assumptions can be observed in studies of technology vis-à-vis the"
"world in general. Edgerton identifies several issues with those assumptions. The first is"
"that such studies are usually innovation-centric, and hence, cannot be global (because"
"technological innovations usually emerge from particular local contexts) – but the authors"
"of such studies do “make claims for the relationship between technology and the process"
""
"of globalisation”.77 The second is that such studies, focused on innovation as they are, do"
"not give sufficient weight to the productivity of relatively poorer nations. Instead, their"
"“innovation-centric techno-globalism” focus more on technologies of communication"
"(such as the Internet), especially their role in making irrelevant the nation-state and"

"creating a global village.78 A third issue is that techno-globalist accounts rely on “historical"
"amnesia”. Edgerton shares the example of Henry Ford forgetting the role of the steamship,"
"railway and telegraph in bringing the world closer together, in his attempt to praise the"
""
"car, airplane and the wireless (radio).79"
""
"To contrast with the last example, Edgerton pulled out the cynical view of George"
"Orwell, who wrote in 1944, “Actually, the effect of modern inventions has been to"

"Summary"
""
"This Study Unit discusses some of the implications for nation-states in this Digital Age. It"
"discusses some of the ways a nation imagines and reiterates itself, from historical modes"
"of communication to more recent digital versions, which are also utilised by the State"
"to ensure a certain vision of the nation. We must also be aware that digital mediums"
"of communication can also cut the other way, i.e. undermine the logic and integrity of"
"the nation-state, by providing voices to dissenting voices who may not always believe"
"in the commonly held vision of the nation. The business rationale and approach of the"
"so-called Big Tech companies (both American and PRC versions) also demonstrate that"
"individuals, communities and nations could have given up more than they bargained for,"
"in return for more convenience, efficiency, and/or higher standard of living. Some of these"
"tensions have made their way into the international arena, where the key characteristics"
"of globalisation (e.g. movement and exchanges of goods, services, ideas and labour)"
"become weaponised this Digital Age. Digital technologies have advanced earlier forms of"
"espionage, to a point where hostile neighbours could initiate disinformation campaigns"
"to undermine local societies and economies. At this point of writing, there are several"
"potential flashpoints in the world, e.g. Russia and Ukraine, the USA and the PRC, and"
"more information will be written and published at a quicker pace. It is hence imperative,"
"as the final section of the second chapter of this Study Unit attempts to do, to analyse"
"critically the information and concepts we consume or are fed on a regular basis."

"Formative Assessment"
"1.   Which of the following best describes Benedict Anderson’s understanding of the"
"nation?"
""
"a.     An imagined political community"
""
"Correct. Anderson called the nation an imagined political community"
"because a key characteristic is how people who may not know each other"
"could still imagine themselves as part of the same community."
""
"b.     A country with clear territorial boundaries."
""
"Incorrect. Anderson’s approach expands on this rudimentary understanding"
"of what a nation could be."
""
"c.     A spiritual principle"
""
"Incorrect. This understanding of a nation is attributed to French historian,"
"Ernest Renan, who first discussed the nation in detail in 1882."
""
"d.     A community that has a common print-language"
""
"Incorrect. As described by Anderson, print-language is merely one way of"
"imagining the nation via communication of ideas and beliefs."
""
""
"2.   According to Benedict Anderson, which of the following are characteristics of a"
"nation?"
""
"a.     A nation is limited, sovereign, and its nationalism is based on a political"
"ideology."
""
"Incorrect. Anderson did state that a nation is limited and sovereign, but"
"nationalism should not be seen as a synonym for a political ideology."

""
"Incorrect. Anderson stated that a nation is seen as limited and sovereign."
""
"c.   A nation is based on state-like structures."
""
"Incorrect. See explanation in correct answer."
""
"d.   A nation is limited, sovereign, and not necessarily based on a political"
"ideology."
""
"Correct. Other than being limited and sovereign, Anderson cautions"
"against likening nationalism to any political ideologies. He noted that"
"it would be more productive to approach nationalism and the nation"
"anthropologically, that is to study how nationalism originated, its cultural"
"roots and characteristics of the nation, how both “behaved” and developed"
"over time."
""
""
"3.   Which of the following is the best description of print-language?"
""
"a.   A type of language only found on print documents"
""
"Incorrect. Print-language can be found in other mediums of communication."
""
""
""
"b.   A type of language that creates a unified field of exchange and"
"communication between official and vernacular languages, is fixed and"
"hence transferable, and is usually a vernacular language elevated into"
"politico-cultural significance."
""
"Correct. These are the key characteristics of any print-language as"
"discussed by Benedict Anderson."

"a.   The State refers to a government or governing authority, e.g. a monarch."

"b.   The State refers to an area or territory with clear boundaries."
""
"Incorrect (in the context of this course). While this is one conventional"
"interpretation of the concept, it is not immediately relevant to how the State"

"c.   The State refers to an entity or organisation that enforces laws, executes"

"Correct. This understanding provides a basis to appreciate how the State"
"(and its various apparatus) supports imaginings of the Nation through"
"policies and processes, such as laws, education, community outreach or"
"commemorative events."

"d.   The State refers to an entity or organisation that has a monopoly on the use"

"c.   Surveillance capitalism is a political-economic ideology practiced by the"
